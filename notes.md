# Graduate Certificate in Research Computing


## Curriculum


Next, at least one course for credit would be offered that is required for all
students seeking certification. This course would establish the social and
environmental contexts for research computing, especially surrounding research
design and data management. Upon completing this course, students will be able
to consider the effects of various research computing projects, including
their own, with a critical eye toward greater accountability. A second
required course could reposition the contextual concerns towards doing
research computing “in public,” in the sense of how to analyze and present
research findings with the public as an intended audience or stakeholder.
The required instruction would also feature the Libraries’ CTL-designed course
“Exceptional Scholarship with Research Data.”


Additionally, we foresee students’ taking a number of elective courses. These
courses come from a curated list of courses offered every year. They would not
be offered explicitly for students pursuing the GCRC, but the faculty would
know to expect such students in their classes.


Finally, the certification process would involve a public-facing component
tied to the student’s own research. We envision an event showcasing the work
of the students with presentations and opportunities to host their work
online.


## Audience


Whereas the Foundations bootcamps are aimed at graduate students in general,
in the first iteration of the GCRC, we are targeting PhD students in GSAS who
are still in the coursework phase of their


## Learning Objectives


## Current Environment/Gap (Context of Computation at Columbia)


- PACL work on research data
- “Computing in Context” (CS course)
- FORC as already exists
- DSI as a source of interdisciplinary RC
- Outside of CS offerings






## What If We Offered This Now




RATIONALE - 
What kinds of courses could fill in as electives?
* They have to be broad (interesting to many disciplines), 
* No punishing prereqs / domain specificity
* Open to everyone in the CU system
* Include computation of some kind
Rationale 2.



* Computing in Context (Undergrad / SIPA)
   * Health Policy
   * International Affairs
   * Computing in Finance
   * Computing in Biology
   * Computational Linguistics (Reeve)

Notes:


Problem w/ summer institute is figuring out how to do admin.


how do you pay administrators?


CTL, SPS, and GSAPP have summer options


state-level grad certificate program through GSAS


this would be workshops but also courses


Mellon grant for summer institute? 3 years of startup cash?


Certificate in Research Computing:


* Advisory board
* recurring courses that would satisfy the cert
* contact depts and ask if we can send students to their courses
* contact chairs
* certification:
  * requires a curriculum
  * “if we did this this year,” how would it look?
  * a picture that convinces CU and NY
  * recurring accreditation admin lifting
  * needs support letters
  * begets a summer institute
* Pull job lists for stuff that would benefit from this cert (academic plus,
  etc., data skills needed for more and more tt positions)
* how is this not QMSS?
   * QMSS has alternate tracks, a few reqs, then electives in AMSS


What money is needed for a certificate?


Write for Ann, Jonathan, and Carlos


## Certificate


* Lots of universities have something that is like a half degree in CS
  * Princeton is two CS classes plus two electives
  * Same at Tufts
  * UW
  * Penn
* No real analog for a program that’s outside of CS
* Or something that doesn’t seem to rely wholly on official courses
* Libraries provide the critical/ethical component because we’re far enough
  away from the research that we can give it some space and say, “is this a
  good idea?”
* CS profs might see intrusion of questions of ethics, etc., as not their
  remit. Philosophy isn’t a computer science.
* This shouldn’t be an instrumental masters that takes money with the allure
  of giving students a salary bump afterward.
* How do we address instrumentality as a certificate? Why should students do
  this?
  * “I want to be employable”
  * “I have questions I don’t know how to answer”
  * “I have data I don’t know how to understand”
* CTL isn’t directly involved in making students more employable to be in LAC.
  Teaching teachers to be better teachers is a goal in and of itself.
 
We are in the business of teaching people who have data how to ask questions about that data and prodding them to maintain a critical distance.


* What do we mean by “ethics” or “critical distance,” anyway?
* “What is our duty to unborn people?”
* Think about this in terms of climate change.

Meeting with Roger:


* Who is the intended audience?
  * people with a computation project
    * people whose work is innocuous (from an ethics/critique side)
    * has some ethical problems but are mostly fine
    * ethically terrible, but they don’t see it that way
    --
    * people who are working with data they collect vs. from other sources
    * people working with data about people (PPI, IRB)


(
* Ethics of tech trends:
  * Info sheets about data. An AI version of IRB Michael Bernstein
    self-policing, describing the provenance, etc.
 
* Guidance narratives
)


* What would the people actually do?
  * big danger: guest speakers. They come in w/ no context and fly away
    leaving no trace. CTL keeps this going with having some kind of
    accountability week-to-week. How can this be not just a lecture series?
    * MIT model:
      * semester long working group w/ 3-5 profs and grad students. Everyone
        gets a stipend. Profs are creating curriculum, and the students turn
        the curriculum into projects, etc.
  * Ethics: People come in for two-day workshops, with an idea or picking out
    an idea, and fill out a info sheet about the project as homework. Doing
    readings, talking about readings.
  * ACCOUNTABILITY:
    * this can be a buzzword in the space of the certificate in general.


* concentrated workshops (bootcamp)
* distributed, semester-long workshops
* course for credit
* electives
* public event by the graduate students


## Buzzwords:
  * Accountability - researchers should be accountable for their work
    * What does that accountability look like?
      * Being dragged on twitter
      * Laws don’t keep up
      * Press?
      * compliance / getting sued.
      * (think about how to get EVPR on board)


## Stakeholders:
  * Libraries
  * EVPR
  * CUIT
  * Faculty / perh. via SRCPAC or PACL
  * the students themselves
  * the public
  * the earth
