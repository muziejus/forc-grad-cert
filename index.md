Executive Summary

# Graduate Certificate in Research Computing

## Foundations of Research Computing

With the increasing prevalence of interdisciplinary, cutting-edge research
that relies on research computing (RC) as well as an increasingly
computationally driven job market outside of the professoriat, Columbia
University must produce PhDs who are ready and able to meet these needs,
regardless of their career track. In offering a graduate certificate in
research computing, Columbia will be able to meet the needs of world-class PhD
students as they distinguish themselves with their research. Additionally, the
certification process invites participating PhD students to join the
interdisciplinarily minded community of scholars at Columbia, enabling new
avenues for distinctive research and collaboration.

Given the success of the Foundations in Research Computing bootcamps,
a collaborative endeavor led by the Libraries with support from CUIT and the
Research Office, the graduate certificate would build upon those foundations
with a curriculum overseen by a faculty-led advisory board.

Notes:

Problem w/ summer institute is figuring out how to do admin.

how do you pay administrators?

CTL, SPS, and GSAPP have summer options

state-level grad certificate program through GSAS

this would be workshops but also courses

Mellon grant for summer institute? 3 years of startup cash?

Certificate in Research Computing:

* Advisory board
* recurring courses that would satisfy the cert
* contact depts and ask if we can send students to their courses
* contact chairs
* certification:
  * requires a curriculum
  * “if we did this this year,” how would it look?
  * a picture that convinces CU and NY
  * recurring accreditation admin lifting
  * needs support letters
  * begets a summer institute
* Pull job lists for stuff that would benefit from this cert (academic plus,
  etc., data skills needed for more and more tt positions)
* how is this not QMSS?
   * QMSS has alternate tracks, a few reqs, then electives in AMSS

What money is needed for a certificate?
