Executive Summary

# Graduate Certificate in Research Computing

With the growing prevalence of interdisciplinary, cutting-edge research that relies on research computing (RC) as well as an increasingly computationally driven job market outside of the professoriat, Columbia University must produce PhDs who are ready and able to meet these needs, regardless of their career track. In offering a graduate certificate in research computing, Columbia will continue to meet the needs of world-class PhD students as they distinguish themselves with their research. Additionally, the certification process invites participating PhD students to join the interdisciplinarily minded community of scholars at Columbia, enabling new avenues for distinctive research and collaboration.

With this document, we propose that the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with Office of the Executive Vice President for Research, Columbia University Information Technologies, and the Columbia University Libraries, establish a formal graduate certificate in research computing, earned by PhD students who complete a for-credit curriculum featuring both certificate-specific required courses and already existing elective courses. The certificate will also include training in computation enhanced by workshops and additional courses administered by the Libraries and a public-facing component with students presenting their work to the larger academic world.

Our suggestions are preliminary and provide only a launchpad for the work of a more formal committee featuring the members of the bodies mentioned above. We imagine, however, a set of learning objectives as follows:

* Describe and extend the qualities of exceptional research computing
* Analyze, critique, and question inherent assumptions of research computing
* Interpret, assess, and argue for strategies for managing research data
* Synthesize, defend, and support an ethically driven, critical computation
* Design, develop, and generate a computationally intensive doctoral research project
* Produce a presentation that illustrates and models exceptional research computing


Given the success of the Foundations in Research Computing bootcamps, a collaborative endeavor led by the Libraries with support from CUIT and the Research Office, the graduate certificate would build upon those foundations with a curriculum overseen by a faculty-led advisory board.

Notes:

Problem w/ summer institute is figuring out how to do admin.

how do you pay administrators?

CTL, SPS, and GSAPP have summer options

state-level grad certificate program through GSAS

this would be workshops but also courses

Mellon grant for summer institute? 3 years of startup cash?

Certificate in Research Computing:

* Advisory board
* recurring courses that would satisfy the cert
* contact depts and ask if we can send students to their courses
* contact chairs
* certification:
  * requires a curriculum
  * “if we did this this year,” how would it look?
  * a picture that convinces CU and NY
  * recurring accreditation admin lifting
  * needs support letters
  * begets a summer institute
* Pull job lists for stuff that would benefit from this cert (academic plus,
  etc., data skills needed for more and more tt positions)
* how is this not QMSS?
   * QMSS has alternate tracks, a few reqs, then electives in AMSS

What money is needed for a certificate?
